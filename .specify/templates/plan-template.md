# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Java 21, TypeScript (Node LTS) or "Multi-language (Java + TypeScript)"]  
**Languages/Versions (by component)**: [List per component if multi-service; include any cross-cutting versions]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [List per component if multi-service; include observability + messaging deps]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Use `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as the source of truth. At minimum, confirm:

- **KISS + Clean Code**: The plan avoids over-engineering; complexity is explicitly justified if present.
- **DDD + Clean Architecture**: Domain boundaries are explicit; dependencies flow inward; contracts are defined.
- **Microfrontends + Shell**: Shell ownership and microfrontend ownership are explicit.
- **Trunk-based + Feature flags**: Rollout is controlled by flags; merges are small and frequent.
- **Parity**: Local vs cloud behavior is aligned (configs, dependencies, runtime assumptions).
- **Observability**: The plan includes a journey correlation strategy (`journeyId`) and telemetry integration.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
